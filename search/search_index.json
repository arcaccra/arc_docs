By the end of day 4 we had managed to cultivate enough self-initiative and collective alignment for 3 teams to organically form. The extent to which these were indeed organic processes was evidenced by how the teams sought internal coherence for the remainder of the project, navigating inevitable frictions as they tried out self-governance practices, and stretching themselves to deliver a result they were proud of, as a team, in a timely manner. By the end of the intensive, each team had begun their development into an effective organisation. Two and a half weeks was more than enough for an in-person, all-day-every-day intensive. Fortunately this was agreed upon prior to the start of the in-person activities. Of the participants that registered and/ or attended online enrolment calls, the engagement during the in-person period was moderate. However, another learning was that it is a lot to ask of people to make themselves available full-time for two weeks. In some cases, participants had taken holiday to participate, although this was considered as an exceptionally successful level of engagement. In terms of adaptive changes, there was continuous evaluation, both formally via whole-team syncs on the balcony outside the learning space at the end of the day, as well as informally in any other moment, such as the taxi ride home, the kitchen, and in between workshops crashed-out on the beanbag. Fortunately, we had set up a voice-based reflection practice, which received over 400 reflections during the 3 week period around the intensive, which is made available online here. One improvement for next time would be to accept multiple forms of media into this system, as collating all documents of workshops and presentations after successfully encouraging decentralisation has been like trying to herd cats.</p> KPI Metric Result Co-design workshops held Weekly for 4 weeks; \u2265 4 total sessions True (after duration update) Weekly participation in feedback sessions \u2265 75% of participants engage weekly True* Adaptive changes made based on evaluations \u2265 1 documented change per week, if needed True Workshop documentation and reports submitted 100% of sessions reported with presentation materials True (eventually) <p>Note on the weekly participation in feedback: Of the 3 feedback forms used routinely throughout the intensive to gather feedback from the cohort as a whole, the 'Growth Form' is identified by our Evaluation Lead, Shik, as the most important. As is evidenced in Weekly Feedback Data &amp; Participation Statistics, this form gathered 92% and 100% participation for weeks 1 and 2 respectively. On this basis, we are considering this KPI a pass, although note the low participation on other forms as possible room for improvement for next time, nonetheless. Shik also noted the possible cause of low participation rates as being ambiguity around incentives. This is something we will double-down on going forwards. </p>"},{"location":"ALJ%20Intensive/Catalyst%20submission/Closeout%20Report/#cross-phase-strategic-kpis","title":"Cross-Phase / Strategic KPIs","text":"<p>For us, producing engaging accounts of the learning experience is very important. We haven't seen as much engagement in our material as we would have liked to and we'll address that going forwards by creating a centralised/ integrative page for a given event, sign-posting to various other perspectives/ apps. The local ecosystem engagement, in all honesty, was dire. There could have been much more action made by the local teams who were eager, but sometimes could have benefited from greater focus. The budgeting is considered a hindrance in this regard, leaving too much room for people to start thinking in terms of \"what's needed to get this done?\" instead of \"what would be needed for the best possible future imaginable for my community?\" For example, the hiring of an external videographer became a strong point of friction. Someone coming in to get the job done, with minimal intention to engage with the purpose of the process as a whole, in a role with a very qualitative output - is a missed opportunity. Contrasting that with the whole premise of self-organising and the abundance of talent present in Accra, it's a clear learning for next time to activate that role more purposefully next time around. The Cardano platform awareness was evident. With a very strong onboarding workshop that perfectly equipped participants with the essential knowledge needed to feel confident in their endeavours, almost all participants were actively thinking in terms of genuinely worthwhile real-world use-cases of Cardano. APIs were made available to help bridge the gap for the devs which were still onboarding to writing code, let alone smart contracts. Given the immense will generated for their self-initiated projects (which was a product of intention program design, not a coincidence), where they began prototyping with Cardano toolkits, it's a high likelihood that at least the first stage of their developer journeys will be with/ through the Cardano ecosystem. Feedback forms were used which recorded several reflections on their adoption of Cardano functionality in the development of their prototypes.</p> KPI Metric Results Stakeholder retention rate % of initial stakeholders engaged through final report Low Local ecosystem engagement Number of local actors (businesses, devs, leaders) involved Low Cardano platform awareness % of participants who demonstrate understanding post-event (via surveys or feedback) High"},{"location":"ALJ%20Intensive/Catalyst%20submission/Closeout%20Report/#4-key-achievements","title":"4.

Small-group breakouts were frequently mentioned, with people valuing the space to freely express themselves and contribute to problem-solving.
