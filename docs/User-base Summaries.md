# User-base Summaries
## Context
This page outlines early-stage documentation and community insights gathered by the Accra hub as part of preparations for the upcoming in-person intensive. As a locally grounded learning centre, the hub plays a key role in direct outreach, communication, and participant sign-ups for the event. Many of the prospective participants are already active within our networks and local initiatives. While formal documentation may be limited at this stage, our approach is grounded in trust and local knowledge. The user base referenced here draws from a much broader pool of community members, with whom we have longstanding engagement, and from which we are confident a committed group will join the co-design process and help develop locally relevant dApps during the event.
