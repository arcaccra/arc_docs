Here's the event organising by four [[core processes]] in the form of a checklist. 

**1. Enrolment: Aligning Energies Around Potential**

- [ ] **Hub and facilitation teams** identified and aligned around the vision. 
- [ ] Roles and responsibilities clearly defined. 
- [ ] Invitations extended to diverse stakeholders (community, sector experts, facilitators, etc.). 
- [ ] Alignment of capacities (art, tech, community, etc.) with the event’s vision. 
- [ ] Clear process for **role fit** to ensure alignment with event goals. 
- [ ] Signing up further participants and stakeholders

**2. Ground-Potentializing: Managing Scope & Readiness**

- [ ] **Clear focus and vision for the ALJ** is defined (what’s the system of focus?).
- [ ] Scope of the event **contained**—preventing overreach while still allowing for flexibility.
- [ ] **Stakeholder expectations** managed around the ALJ's vision of potential.
- [ ] **On-the-ground realities** mapped (e.g., logistical, cultural, financial).
- [ ] **Alignment** between the approach (process, methods) and the desired outcomes.
- [ ] **External parties** (government, funders, experts) engaged where needed.
- [ ] **Communication channels** set up for ongoing updates and feedback loops.
- [ ] **Contingency plans** for unforeseen constraints or changes.

**3. Action: Designing for Self-Organizing Emergence**

- [ ] Facilitation design that **supports self-organization**—ensuring autonomy while maintaining focus.
- [ ] **Context-specific [[practice|practices]]** are identified to reflect the [[place]]’s unique dynamics.
- [ ] Event designed with a **living systems approach**—encouraging natural flows and interconnectedness.
- [ ] Clear facilitation strategies for **embodying a potential system state** (role play, prototyping, etc.).
- [ ] **Tools and methods** prepared to track emergent actions (e.g., feedback mechanisms, observation).
- [ ] Opportunities for **hands-on learning and experimentation** included.

**4. Evaluation: Making Flows of Energy Visible & Valued**

- [ ] **Evaluation metrics** defined (not just outcome-based but energy flows, relationships, etc.).
- [ ] Tools for making **invisible shifts visible** (e.g., stories, feedback, surveys).
- [ ] **Documentation strategies** in place to capture the energy, relationships, and outputs.
- [ ] **Reflection periods** built into the event to assess progress and adjust actions.
- [ ] Methods for **sharing results** with external stakeholders or wider community.
- [ ] Follow-up plans to ensure the insights or innovations continue post-event.

While the above checklist focuses on the ***facilitation processes*** of an ALJ, almost all conventional elements around organising an event should also be considered:

1. **Logistics**
    - [ ]  Venue logistics (location, capacity, accessibility).
    - [ ]  **Technical setup** (AV, internet, equipment, materials).
    - [ ]  **Budget and financial planning** (funding, expenses, donations, grants).
    - [ ]  **Transportation and accommodation** (for remote participants or speakers).

2. **Marketing & Communication**
    - [ ]  **Marketing materials** (event pages, brochures, flyers).
    - [ ]  **Communication strategy** (pre-event updates, social media, email).
    - [ ]  **Branding and messaging** (clear communication of the event’s vision and objectives).

3. **Participant Engagement**
    - [ ]  **Onboarding materials** for participants (event guidelines, schedules).
    - [ ]  **Clear call-to-action** for participants—what is expected of them?
    - [ ]  **Support for diverse needs** (language, accessibility, emotional support).

4. **Risk Management** 
    - [ ]  **Health and safety protocols** in place.
    - [ ]  **Insurance coverage** (for public liability, cancellation, etc.).
    - [ ]  **Emergency procedures** (for accidents, crises, or unexpected situations).

5. **Post-Event Follow-Up** 
    - [ ]  **Survey for participant feedback** (gather insights on experience and improvement).
    - [ ]  **Evaluation report** (summarize outcomes, learnings, and next steps).
    - [ ]  **Continued community engagement** (to sustain momentum and outcomes).
