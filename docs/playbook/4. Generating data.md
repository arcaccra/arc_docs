[^1]: Bots is an abbreviation for any lightweight system that has a minimal user-experience and performs a simple function to generate a participation signal. The user-experience could be to add a quick message to a chat channel, or could even be part of some other work that the "bot" picks up, such as managing task cards/ github issues. For almost all of them, voice interface is a strong preference because it supports the most collective flow during the intensive.
