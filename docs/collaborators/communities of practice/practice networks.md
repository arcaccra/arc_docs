# practice networks
prisma is a framework for communities of practice and [[hubs]] to self-organise [[action-learning journeys]], and the governance infrastructure to complement. 

we're working closely with [[Regenesis]] [^1], who are evolving a practice of regenerative development and design. 

at the core of our [[Prisma as Process|methodologies]] is the dynamic interplay between the forward movement of [[docs/Glossary/Enactment|enacting]] (action) and the ongoing, reflective and integrative movement of [[a. Introduction|evaluating]] (learning). our work is to develop these methodologies and the infrastructures supporting organising such events. 

[[action-learning journeys]] are a period of rapid innovation, guided by a facilitator team that has been co-designing with the [[hubs]] for a number of months - each event requiring several months of intention development, co-design, alignment and systems onboarding.[^2] 

we are designing a [[Holochain|minimum viable governance system]] to support...

1. External capability development of event [[participants]]
	- code, [[practice]] and [[product]] quality
	- place-unique (digital) expressions of developmental inquiries into the essence of place [^3]
2. Internal capability development
	- the facilitator team's capability to work with the underlying, generative patterns for organising [[action-learning journeys]] 
	- increasing [[process design collective|order]] of design and effect

both streams are in service to activating and making visible the multiple forms of value creation and exchange involved in thriving regenerative community. these events are developed in partnership with [[hubs]], with a core steward (group), and in partnership with regional hubs. the aim is for the event to be a catalytic agent for the self-expression of place-sourced practices, developed and applied to grow bioregional wealth.

> *aims to* apply this governance system to facilitate the self-organising of place-sourced [[action-learning journeys]]â€¦
> 
> *in order to* produce a suite of developmental case studies that engage a broader (global) audience with the work of regenerative development and design
> 
> *in a way that* enables practitioners working on-the-ground to communicate the essence of their work **themselves** 
> 
> *so that* the instrument used to communicate the application of practice can evolve **with** the community of practice and the evolving practice itself. 

this governance system aims to multiply the capacity of the facilitator team by creating the conditions that enable...

- **ORGANISATION:** [[enrolment|self-organisation]] by event participants and facilitators for each event instance
- **INTEGRITY:** stewardship of the alignment between the place-sourced [[product|products]] of the intensives and the potential of the non-local community of practice the intensives are being organised for (i.e. [[resourcing]])
- **EVOLVABILITY:** continuity of development impulse beyond the timeframe of the first intensive (see [[incubation methodology]])
# Core Capacities
the following core facilitation team is forming to bring this work forwards:

- [[Delfina Terrado]]: [[docs/Glossary/Enactment|enacting]], [[experience design]], [[incubation methodology]], [[practice-based daos]]
- [[Shikhar Agarwal]]: [[a. Introduction|evaluating]], [[value-system design methodology]], [[Holochain|place-sourced currency design]]
- [[Mercy Fordwoo]]: [[Ground-Potentialising|potentialising]], [[hub networking]]
- [[Ryah Chandler]]: [[enrolment]]
- [[Tobias Fechner]]: [[process infrastructuring]]

See also [[Core Processes]].
# Stakeholder Groups
event capacities are sourced from at least the following four stakeholder groups:

1. [[participants]]
2. [[hubs]]
3. [[practice networks]]
4. [[partners]]

these [stakeholder development pathways](https://register.prisma.events) are being designed to form a 4-8 month onboarding process. 

the [[process infrastructuring]] developed to support the organisation of each event instance is also designed to be configurable and self-contained, able to be deployed to a server/ [[Holochain|device]] network local to the [[hubs]] hosting the event. the purpose of this is to align with the aim of building capacity in-place for ongoing development of the products incubated during the intensive. 

# Instrumenting
instruments supporting this process design are:

- [[publishing]] stack - an evolving knowledge commons
- [[Core Facilitator Capacity|patterns for facilitator teams]] - see [liberating structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/)
- [[DID System]] & reputation - participant registrations, contribution accounting and participation timelines
- A financing distribution methodology and tooling, both internal and external. See [[capital distribution]].
- Organisational agreements-making, serving [[incubation methodology|intensives as incubation processes]]
- [[speech-to-currency]], serving place-unique [[practice-based daos]]

[^3]: The creative tension of glocal: visibility and verification of local network effect at global-scale levels of capital distribution. mediating multiple forms of evaluation and communicating success cases of application of practice. global systemic crises (are [[complex systems]] and) require vast amounts of thinking processing in order to respond collectively and regeneratively. evolving systems at those scales whilst at the same time in alignment with the continuity of life on earth requires place-specific practices. [[practice]] has the role of developing ecological literacy (seeing patterns in nature).
