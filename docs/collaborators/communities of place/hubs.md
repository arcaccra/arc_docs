# hubs
hubs are on-the-ground, physical spaces, which will be identified by a local changemaker or identify themselves as the host of the event. that's the way that the whole onboarding process becomes activated and other stakeholders organise around that. hubs enable the process of co-design. trust cannot be rushed. hubs may take the form of...

- community centres
- bioregional learning centres
- in-person DAOs
- cooperatives/ hosts of cooperative collectives
- co-living and co-working spaces that actively play a stewarding role in their region
- living labs
# hub team
the hub team is the core task force and first contact point for every [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]] (ALJ). the hub team is arguably the most essential factor in a given journey, because they are the access to the locality and the point of initiation for the rest of what will be organised. core responsibilities include:

- local stakeholder engagement and onboarding
- discovering, naming and communicating the ALJ [[aspect]]
- event page
- [[product]] specification 
- capacity requirements & offerings
- funding distribution agreements
# hub onboarding
hub onboarding covers all the steps necessary to become capable of self-organising an ALJ and self-publishing an ALJ [[case-study]]. we are currently aiming for reaching that level of capability with a single ALJ. that means that by the end of the first ALJ, hub teams are capable of... 

- developing and integrating their own [[Core Processes]]
- developing and integrating their own [[publishing]] stack 
- actively participating in future prisma action-learning developments

The images below build up a picture of on of many ways to hold together the different parts of an [[action-learning journeys|action-learning journey]] from the perspective of the hubs.

The participant onboarding process starts *early*. A long facilitated onboarding process is required to align all the different stakeholders involved in an [[action-learning journeys|ALJ]]. Before participant onboarding even begins, there's a short period where the hub team and core facilitation team (prisma) can align on the aims of the ALJ and the purpose of approaching organising a transformation-focussed event in this way.

There are three levels of outcomes that an [[action-learning journeys|ALJ]] can aim for, detailed in [[index|home]]. 

![[event-model_-1.png]]

The prisma core facilitator team is actively facilitating the organising of the first ALJ, from start to completion of the intensive at the end. The process of organising a hub's first ALJ is also a process of onboarding the hub into ALJ organising and case-study publishing capabilities. By the end of the first ALJ, we aim for the hub to be able to organise its next ALJ with minimal/ intermittent support by prisma.

In the process of organising an ALJ, several form of data are generated, which become the content of the [[case-study]] published.
