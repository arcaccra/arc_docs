# Aligning Community Organizing, Capital Allocation, and Financial Capital Sources

At the core of our mission is addressing the gap between how communities organize for regenerative development, how capital is allocated, and how financial capital sources are managed. Traditional approaches are fragmented, often misaligned with local needs, and disproportionately reliant on external funding sources, perpetuating extractive economic models. We see this misalignment as a fundamental barrier to systemic change.

Our solution involves running **collaborative innovation intensives** that align these three elements—community organizing, capital allocation mechanisms, and financial capital sources—into an integrated framework for regenerative development. Through these intensives, the bioregional hubs we partner with evolve into **bioregional venture studios**, designed to incubate projects and organizations that operate within a regenerative economy and are aligned with the ecological health of the bioregion.

# The Emerging Community of Practice: Bioregional Financing Facilities

Our work is aligned with an [emerging community of practice](https://www.biofi.earth/) developing **Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFFs)**—mechanisms designed to channel financial resources toward regenerative projects. For BFFs to succeed, strong community organizing and leadership, rooted in place-based regeneration, must already be in place. This is facilitated by a **Bioregional Organizing Team**—whether a trusted organization or a decentralized network—fostering trust, coherence, and capacity for collective action.

The Bioregional Organizing Team collaborates with **Bioregional Hubs** to create a **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy**, map systems, and build capacity. Once this foundation is strong, a BFF can be established to finance regenerative initiatives, working in synergy with local hubs to decentralize financial governance and drive systemic change.

By running our **collaborative innovation intensives**, we enable bioregional hubs to become **bioregional venture studios**. These hubs serve as incubators for a cohort of regenerative projects, developing the conditions for systemic change within key areas such as food systems, energy, water management, and governance. As bioregional venture studios, these hubs catalyze the development of regenerative business cases and prepare the ground for a **Bioregional Financing Facility** that can finance these efforts.

#### **From Innovation to Implementation: Creating the Conditions for Systemic Change**

Ultimately, the goal of these intensives is to create the enabling conditions for communities to practice new forms of organizing and allocate capital in ways that prioritize ecological health and social well-being. By aligning the organizing and activation efforts of a bioregion with financial capital mechanisms, we enable communities to shift away from dependence on external capital and toward a regenerative flow of all types of capital, including social, ecological, and financial.

Once a strong foundation is in place, a **Bioregional Financing Facility** can be established to fund and finance the implementation of the bioregional regeneration strategy. This facility works closely with the **Bioregional Organizing Team** and **Bioregional Hub** to decentralize financial resource governance, design synergistic project portfolios, and foster the transition to a regenerative economy.

Through this alignment of community organizing, capital allocation, and financial flows, we help bioregions become self-sustaining, resilient ecosystems, where local communities are empowered to steward their own regenerative futures.
