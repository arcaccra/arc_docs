Here we outline our business model, showing its innovative approach to scaling systems change through real-world experimentation.

- [[case-studies]]: the products of each action-learning journey are developmental case studies, aiming to make visible the underlying practice being applied and the learnings that were generated during the intensive. 
- [[action-learning journeys]]: We host events where participants are part of experiential learning journeys, engaging with both cutting-edge technologies and place-sourced practices. These residencies take place in bioregional hubs, where we incubate new solutions that are informed by the context of local communities.
- [[a. Introduction | Evaluation]]: Our evaluation process acts as a capital distribution system, where a small percentage of the value generated is reinvested into future projects, driving both growth and impact.
