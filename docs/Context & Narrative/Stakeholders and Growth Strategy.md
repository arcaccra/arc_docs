# Stakeholders and Growth Strategy
2025 will see the delivery of the [Accra action-learning journey](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/f13-cardano-open-ecosystem/wada-hub-hackathon-a-local-community-catalyst), the start of the [[Regenesis]] Story of Place programme, and potentially a few other exciting collaborations. 

The image above shows the same underlying pattern of event organising, which applies four [[Core Processes]], across three different contexts:

	A. Accra: Wada Hub in Accra, Ghana, for the Cardano Catalyst Fund 13 application
	B. Regenesis: Several events within the Story of Place programme
	C. Additional aligned partners within a broader market-oriented context

In all the [[action-learning journeys]] (ALJs), we are aiming to form one or multiple action-learning teams that work on-the-ground on the development and application of an instrument (tooling). 

Each ALJ also generates content: videos, interviews, call recordings, wikis, art works. This content is curated by the [[hubs]] to publish case-studies of the process. 

These case studies are developmental learning journeys: each with levels of depth. Our [[Core Value-Adding Process and Business Model|business model]] centres around the subscription to these journeys to access the depth. Each event is a catalyst for the ongoing *storying* of the work, making the subscription model appropriate. Communities of place are the owners of these learning journeys and the primary recipients of subscription fees. 

Over time, using these ALJs as the innovation impulse - the engine driving creation - we will build out [[action-learning infrastructure]]. This is to work towards a platform where these events organise themselves and people work in a distributed manner on bioregional transition pathways. All capacities and resourcing is organised and accounted for in a decentralised manner by leveraging these underlying patterns we're working on.
