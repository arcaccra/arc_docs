# An Action-Learning Case Study
Lasting 17 days, 15 participants joined a co-living space in North-West Wales, practicing self-organising at the scale of a single household. The [[aspect]] of this action-learning journey was Knowledge Commoning, which aimed to make visible the inquiry into the system(s) of how communities gather, store and evolve what and how they know. The following [prototype](https://vdev.substack.com/p/ai-librarian) was developed.

An enlivened space of creative potential, the group practiced sociocracy, forming circles, twice, daily, to hear each others' experience of the experiment in self-organising and make decisions, collectively.

The product discovered and incubated during the journey was a semantic web crawler that complemented a 12-stage knowledge commons framework. The two parts worked together to form the foundation for a multi-perspectival knowledge commons. Local organisations guided the direction of the process from day 1, and by the end of the 17 days a multi-stakeholder guild had formed with will to continue the initiative further, applying the tooling in the local context.
