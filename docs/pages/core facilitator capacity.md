Core facilitator capacity refers to the essential competencies and skills required by facilitator teams to effectively guide [[action-learning journeys]] and support the self-organization of [[communities of place]] and [[communities of practice]]. These capacities are crucial for ensuring that events are well-designed, enacted, and evaluated to catalyze systemic change.

### **Key Facilitator Competencies**
1. **Enactment**  
   - Ability to co-design and enact events that align with the essence of place, fostering a deep sense of connection and shared purpose among participants.
   - Skill in creating environments that encourage experimentation and innovation.

2. **Developmental Evaluation**  
   - Competence in conducting ongoing, reflective evaluations to inform adaptive strategies and track emergent patterns.
   - Ability to integrate feedback loops into event design for continuous improvement.

3. **Process Infrastructuring**  
   - Knowledge of designing and deploying process infrastructures (e.g., [[Holochain]]-based systems) to support event organization and participant onboarding.
   - Understanding of how to configure systems for self-contained deployments.

4. **Potentializing**  
   - Capacity to develop the image, articulation, and communication of future events, ensuring alignment with local contexts and stakeholder needs.
   - Skill in validating event designs through developmental evaluation.

5. **Hub Networking**  
   - Ability to engage with and support local hubs in their role as stewards of transition, fostering trust and collaboration.

### **Challenges and Opportunities**
Facilitating action-learning journeys presents unique challenges, such as managing diverse stakeholder expectations and ensuring long-term sustainability. However, these challenges also offer opportunities for innovation and growth:

13. **Innovative Event Design**: Developing novel formats that integrate local contexts and global best practices.
14. **Decentralized Governance**: Implementing decentralized governance models to enhance transparency and community involvement.
15. **Capacity Building for Resilience**: Developing capacities for self-organization and resilience within facilitator teams.
