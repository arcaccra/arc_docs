The term **enactment** refers to the **active, lived processes** through which systems, knowledge, and ways of organizing emerge. Rooted in **embodied cognition** and **systems thinking**, enactment emphasizes that systems are **brought into being through interaction**—they don't pre-exist as static entities but arise through the collective practices of their participants. This idea is inspired by theorists like **Evan Thompson**, **Francisco Varela**, and the principle of **autopoiesis**, which highlights the self-organizing and self-sustaining nature of living systems.

In our methodology, enactment describes how **new social structures**—such as governance models or economic systems—are co-created by the actions, relationships, and innovations of participants in collaborative spaces. For example, the **civic infrastructures** we help develop are not imposed from the outside but are **enacted** through **self-organizing practices**, such as experimenting with governance frameworks like **sociocracy** or developing **Web3-based currencies**. These new systems emerge dynamically, shaped by the interactions and feedback loops among participants, aligning with the broader principles of **living systems**.

By focusing on enactment, we emphasize the role of **practice-based approaches** in systems change, where the collective engagement of people **co-creates the conditions** for new societal infrastructures to emerge. Through this lens, [[a. Introduction|evaluation]] becomes essential to make sense of the value generated by these processes, balancing innovation with reflection.

# Questions and Reflections Raised by Enactment

1. **How are we creating the system as we engage with it?**
   - Enactment challenges participants and facilitators to reflect on how their practices are actively **shaping the system** they are part of. It invites awareness of the **participatory** and **relational** nature of systems change.
2. **How do we cultivate the conditions for the emergence of new systems?**
   - Enactment requires creating an environment where **new practices** can be safely explored, embodied, and iterated upon. What are the **practices, tools, and relationships** that foster this kind of innovation?
3. **How do we balance enactment with reflection and evaluation?**
   - While enactment involves activating new ways of being, **evaluation** (particularly developmental evaluation) ensures that we are learning from the process and understanding the value of what is emerging. How can we create **feedback loops** that allow for both **action** and **sense-making**?
