Narratives are interpretive structures that shape our perceptions and guide our actions by providing meaning to everyday reality. They help us organize raw sensory experiences into a coherent understanding, a process that largely operates at a subconscious level. Rather than simply being collections of related stories, narratives are complex, adaptive systems that evolve, interact, and influence one another across time and contexts. Just as ecosystems comprise interdependent layers, narratives also have layers: material expressions (like stories or symbols) and deeper virtual elements (such as cultural assumptions and beliefs) that shape collective sense-making.

In systems-change work, narratives hold “political currency” because they reinforce or challenge the cultural and ideological frames through which we view social issues, such as equality, sustainability, and identity. By intentionally reframing narratives, change agents can influence belief systems, helping communities reimagine and reconstruct their understanding of the world. This approach views narratives as “living systems” with the capacity to evolve, terminate, and even merge with others, much like species in a biological ecosystem, allowing for dynamic adaptation to new social or environmental contexts.

Narratives shape our understanding of reality, influencing our beliefs and actions, often operating at multiple interrelated levels from everyday discourse to core identities and values. Implicit narratives set boundaries on acceptable discourse, making it crucial for social change efforts to analyse and reframe these narratives to dismantle regressive belief systems. By understanding the dynamics of narratives—through mapping, reframing, and strategic messaging—organizations can identify intervention points, counteract opposing influences, and create more just and equitable futures  .
