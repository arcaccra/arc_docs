# Day 1 - Accra Action Learning Journey

The Accra Action Learning Journey (ALJ) commenced its first day at the Accra Resource Centre with 12 enthusiastic participants drawn from various backgrounds, including community organizers, educators, environmental advocates, and youth leaders. The morning session began with a dynamic and interactive exercise facilitated by Tobias, which focused on the principles of teamwork, collaboration, and shared leadership. Participants engaged in group activities and reflective conversations that explored their individual strengths and how these contribute to team effectiveness. Each person was invited to express what they believed made them a valuable team member, resulting in a rich dialogue that emphasized empathy, communication, and adaptability.

By mid-morning, at 11:00 a.m., Delfine joined the session and introduced an engaging exercise aimed at community immersion. She guided the group on a neighborhood walk around the vicinity of the Resource Centre, encouraging participants to observe their surroundings with fresh perspectives. The objective was to draw connections between infrastructure, social interactions, environmental cues, and economic activity. Upon returning, participants engaged in a debrief where they shared insightful observations about their own communities, ranging from waste management and urban planning to youth engagement and accessibility. The exercise fostered a deeper appreciation of systemic challenges and the importance of local context when designing community-based interventions.


In the final session of the day, around 2:00 p.m. GMT, Shikhar facilitated an evaluation and reflection activity designed to help participants internalize their learnings and articulate their personal purpose. The session began with small group discussions where individuals shared what drives them and the kind of impact they hope to make. This was followed by a larger group discussion in which participants spoke openly about the roles they would like to take responsibility for, both within their communities and in broader contexts. These roles ranged from promoting real-world applicability of their skills to fostering relationship development, civic leadership, and systemic change.
