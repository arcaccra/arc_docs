We suggested the creation of a  system where households  keep and separate some varieties of wastes like plastics for able recycling. Therefore ,we require a person (liaison or extension officer) who has to act as an intermediary to help get the specific wastes (plastic) to recycling companies.
	The system seeks to involve three parties : the waste creators, the waste collectors and the recycling companies in the life cycle of plastic. We connect the waste creator to the waste collector directly through an app or a bot system on telegram.
	Demonstration of how the system works:
	I have waste I want to discard, I hail a waste collector and he comes to my location. If my waste is sorted I get a discount on the fee paid for the service. When the waste collector sends the waste to the recycling company they are paid for the plastic they bring in since there is potential value in recycling them.
	Different implementation are brought on board depending on the platform the system would be on. 
An App system:
User APP(waste creators): 
Allows users to request waste pickup
Offers discounts for pre-sorted waste
Tracks pickup history & rewards

Collector App (waste pickers):
Accepts pickup request via GPS
Confirms waste type (sorted/unsorted)
Delivers to recycling centers

Recycling Company Dashboard:
verifies & weighs received waste
approves payments to collectors 

Basic Blockchain Integration:
