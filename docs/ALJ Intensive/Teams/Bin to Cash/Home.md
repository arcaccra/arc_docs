## 🚨 The Problem We Couldn't Ignore[¶](https://www.arcaccra.com/ALJ%20Intensive/Teams/Bin%20to%20Cash/Home/Home/#the-problem-we-couldnt-ignore "Permanent link")

Plastic waste is everywhere in Ghana — choking drains, polluting communities, and creating health risks. But most of it **never gets recycled**. Why?

- Lack of sorting at source
- Few incentives to collect or recycle
- No connection between waste creators and recyclers
