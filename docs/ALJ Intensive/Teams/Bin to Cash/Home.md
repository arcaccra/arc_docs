#  Bin to Cash: Turning Plastic Waste into Livelihoods

> "We believe waste can create wealth — and our journey proves it."


##  The Problem We Couldn't Ignore
Plastic waste is everywhere in Ghana — choking drains, polluting communities, and creating health risks. But most of it **never gets recycled**. Why?

- Lack of sorting at source
- Few incentives to collect or recycle
- No connection between waste creators and recyclers

>  **Only 10% of Ghana’s plastic waste is recycled** — the rest ends up in landfills or the ocean.

##  Our Journey: From Frustration to Innovation[¶](https://www.arcaccra.com/ALJ%20Intensive/Teams/Bin%20to%20Cash/Home/Home/#our-journey-from-frustration-to-innovation "Permanent link")

We started by listening: talking to households, collectors, recyclers, and local authorities. What we learned shaped every step.

###  Phase 1: Understanding the Landscape[¶](https://www.arcaccra.com/ALJ%20Intensive/Teams/Bin%20to%20Cash/Home/Home/#phase-1-understanding-the-landscape "Permanent link")

- Visited one community
- Observed informal waste collection
- Interviewed 20 recyclers

### Phase 2: What isn't Working
- There isn't an efficient means to connect the stakeholders in the system
- Current systems doesn't have a lot of waste creators on board 

###  Phase 3: The Breakthrough
We realized we needed **a simple, trackable system** with **instant incentives** for: - Proper sorting - Timely pickup - Verified recycling

### The Solution: Bin to Cash MVP

**Bin to Cash** is a digital platform that connects: - **Households** who sort plastic waste 

**Collectors** who pick it up (electric bikes in future) - **Recyclers** who pay per kg

###  How It Works

`Sort → Collect → Verify → Pay`

- Households sort and log waste in the app
    
- Collectors confirm and weigh pickup
    
- Verified data triggers instant mobile rewards
    
- Recyclers receive sorted plastic on demand
