> "We believe waste can create wealth — and our journey proves it."

## 🚨 The Problem We Couldn't Ignore

Plastic waste is everywhere in Ghana — choking drains, polluting communities, and creating health risks. But most of it **never gets recycled**. Why?

- Lack of sorting at source  
- Few incentives to collect or recycle  
- No connection between waste creators and recyclers



> 📊 **Only 10% of Ghana’s plastic waste is recycled** — the rest ends up in landfills or the ocean.

## 🛤️ Our Journey: From Frustration to Innovation

We started by listening: talking to households, collectors, recyclers, and local authorities. What we learned shaped every step.

### 🟡 Phase 1: Understanding the Landscape
- Visited 15+ communities
- Observed informal waste collection
- Interviewed 20 recyclers

### 🔴 Phase 2: What Didn't Work
- Tried cash-for-waste without verification
- Piloted an SMS-only system (low adoption)

### 🟢 Phase 3: The Breakthrough
We realized we needed **a simple, trackable system** with **instant incentives** for:
- Proper sorting
- Timely pickup
- Verified recycling

- 🏭 **Recyclers** who pay per kg

### 🔁 How It Works

```plaintext
Sort → Collect → Verify → Pay
