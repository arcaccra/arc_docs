The good the bad and the ugly

All the loose ends I'm picking up submitting M4. (All the shit their AIs produce which they've used)

Ez: Closeout report: Project name was incorrect

Ez: Closeout report: Milestone KPIs were inconsistent with mielstone module

Shik: Closeout report: stopped on "Where do KPIs come from?" and paused the whole milestone submission there... indefinitely.
