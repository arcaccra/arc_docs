[Wada Hub Hackathon: A Local Community Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/13/cardano-open-ecosystem/wada-hub-hackathon-a-local-community-catalyst)

IdeaScale ID: 1300190 – the official listing where the project was proposed, voted on, and funded within the Catalyst ecosystem.

Project Manager: Tobias Fechner, Process Infrastructure Lead at Prisma, responsible for overall delivery of the project.

# 2. Project Timeline

Start Date: February 1, 2025 – initiation of Milestone 1 activities, including stakeholder mapping, outreach to prospective participants, and initiation of conversations with potential partners.

Beginning of Enrollment: March 31, 2025 – initiated preparatory workshops for the screened and selected participants.

In-person Hackathon & Intensive Workshops: May 18–31, 2025 – a focused two-week collaborative sprint in Accra bringing together developers, domain experts, and entrepreneurs. The first week focused on foundational concepts such as living systems, decentralised decision making and self-organising teams. The second week consisted entirely of market validation, product design iteration and prototyping.

Excursion to Dream Village, Dambai: Participants visited Dream Village, a living lab for regenerative practice. This experience, integrated early in the intensive, served as a catalyst — exposing participants to radically participatory, sustainable solutions and inspiring them to frame their blockchain experiments through systems thinking and deep place-based engagement.

Final Deliverables Submission: May 31, 2025 – all prototype dApps were presented and the code was submitted. Teams had one week to prepare for the pitches to the evaluation panel consisting of 5 judges from partner organisations across the fields of regeneration, funding, web 3.0 and social impact.

# 3. Project KPIs and Outcomes
Project-specific KPIs (as defined in original proposal):

### **1. Identification of Lead Impulses and Initial Stakeholder Engagement**

We considered the on-the-ground "hub team" (Accra Resource Centre) as the source of the lead impulses, as they are the ones we would be continuing to develop the work going forwards, and therefore would be considered as the primary leaders of anythig after the end of the program. There were 2 core leaders identified, who signed a letter of commitment that was submitted as part of milestone 1. The users were identified through the hub team also, helping us get in touch with local communities of developers and entrepreneurs. The users of potential prototypes were identified by participants themselves during their own outreach throughout the program. Core competencies were co-designed between prisma and the hub and published onto the hub's site (the same site as this page is published on). In the end we went for 100% local developer engagement, without any external developers joining, besides those from the core facilitation team.

5. Key Achievements
Strengthened Partnerships: Formalized collaboration agreements with Wada as the network partner, Dream Village as the techno-village partner, and ARC as the local hub, establishing governance structures and resource commitments.


Community Growth: Successfully onboarded 22 new Cardano developers, forming 3 multidisciplinary teams that delivered working prototypes, with plans for ongoing mentorship and community meetups.


Deliverable Impact (dApps developed):


Bin-to-cash: a Cardano blockchain-based incentivised waste disposal and recycling pipeline built on Telegram bots - creating a win-win-win model for house-holds, waste-collectors and recycling companies..


Carpool: a decentralized carpooling service leveraging Cardano blockchain for seamless peer-to-peer transactions to help alleviate traffic congestion in Accra - with a focus on collating employee pick ups and drop offs.


Bars-on-Bars: an AA-like support platform that integrates messaging, behavioral incentives, and structured mentorship programs to combat addiction in local communities - especially in schools and universities.


Prototype Delivery & Pitch: All three teams developed fully functional prototypes during the intensive phase and delivered polished pitches one week following completion of the in-person hackathon.


Field Visits & Real-World Models: Participants conducted a site visit to Dream Village in Dambai, an established permaculture eco-village designed around community-driven sustainable solutions. Inspired by Dream Village’s participatory design and local resource optimization, the cohort examined how eco-village principles—such as decentralized energy, cooperative governance, and circular waste management—could inform blockchain-based community models back in Accra.


Knowledge Assets: Produced one detailed multimedia case study and a suite of facilitation guides, templates, and best-practice documents for replication in other Ghanaian cities.

6. The Evaluation Process
Preparation & Design: 
Value themes and their weights (Social Relationality, Learning, Creativity, Productivity) were co-created by participants during enrollment calls and a live “Valuing Workshop.”
Extensive theoretical grounding in systemic thinking and participatory design set evaluation priorities before hands-on activity.
Multi-Modal Tracking:
Telegram Timelining: Daily, participants logged reflections, stories, and verified value-contribution entries using carefully designed bot schemas—for example, peer-verified acts of support (Social Relationality), milestone logs (Productivity), idea sparks (Creativity), and explicit before/after learning (Learning).
Structured Forms:
Self & Peer Evaluation: Daily forms (built with Tally) tracked interpersonal relations, learning/growth, creativity, and contribution—requiring both numeric ratings and example-backed narrative for both self and peers.
Facilitation Feedback: Anonymous forms before and after the intensive captured feedback on leadership, group process, and facilitation methods.
ALJ “Pulse” Forms: Sense-checking at key intervals measured changes in motivation, group energy, and expectations.
Multi-Perspectival Data Synthesis:
Data from all forms, timelining entries, peer and facilitator feedback, and team outputs were aggregated into a graph database (Neo4j). GraphRAG enabled deep, longitudinal querying—cross-referencing peer scores with timeline entries, surfacing patterns in social support, creative bursts, and quiet productivity alike.
Statistical analysis (via Jupyter Notebooks) visualized distributions, highlighted score trajectories, and empowered fair, evidence-driven decisions.
Rigorous Ranking:
For individuals: Composite scores incorporated self/peer ratings, qualitative “power up” mentions, and verified timeline value contributions.
For teams: Weighted scores, determined by the co-created schema, synthesized all data streams across Regenerative Growth, Team Potential, and Business Viability.
Visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, radar plots) documented the entire process; rankings directly determined transparent prize distribution.


7. Key Learnings
Successful Elements:


In-Person Intensive Format: The two-week in-person immersive format fostered accelerated trust, communication, and iterative development cycles.


Emergent Prototyping: Applying emergent-learning principles helped participants rapidly co-identify and refine high-priority use cases, enhancing solution relevance.


Systemic Framing: Addressing community problems from a systems perspective led to solutions with deeper, regenerative logic.


Self-Organizing Leadership: Trusting in decentralized group process mobilized collective intelligence and rapid iteration.


Field Learning: The excursion to Dream Village and street-level customer discovery proved that direct community validation is vital to refining solutions and ensuring relevance.


Improvement Opportunities:


Introducing a structured remote orientation phase two weeks prior could decrease the initial onboarding friction and maximize hackathon time.


Allocating dedicated facilitators for non-technical roles (e.g., project management, UX research) would support participants less familiar with agile hackathon environments.


Unexpected Insights:


Strong demand emerged for blockchain-based supply-chain traceability solutions among local agricultural cooperatives, indicating a strategic opportunity for a specialized follow-on cohort.
Narrative depth in voice notes often flagged deeper “systemic” value than numeric ratings captured.


7. Next Steps for the Solutions Developed
Short-Term Actions:


Finalize the case-study package and push to GitHub, ARC website, and Catalyst repositories.


Schedule and promote a virtual demo day with partners and potential funders to secure pilot commitments.


Medium- to Long-Term Plans:


Expand the Action-Learning Journey model to additional Ghanaian hubs (Kumasi, Tamale), leveraging refined facilitation frameworks.


Pursue follow-on Catalyst funding, corporate sponsorships, or grant opportunities to support a second cohort and deepen community engagement.


8. Final Thoughts and Comments
The Accra ALJ broke new ground in participatory, systems-driven innovation for Cardano adoption in Accra, Ghana and potentially beyond to other parts of West Africa. Deep preparation, theory grounding, and real-time evaluation set a new standard for value-based programming, and the collaborative process—grounded in lived experience, multidimensional data, and transparent decision-making—yielded results that endure beyond the project’s close. This work demonstrates that when facilitation bridges context, participant voice, and rigorous evaluation, the outcome is not just prototypes—but an ecosystem capable of self-renewal, growth, and continued impact.
