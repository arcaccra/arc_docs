Collaborators started joining both Prisma and Accra Resource Centre repositories, as well as making their own for the work of their respective teams. The purposes of each are outlined alongside the links to repos. 

Team 1 - https://github.com/Dhirti33/car_pool/tree/main - code for their prototype

Team 2 - https://github.com/Ibn-Salih/BinBankV1 - code for their prototype

Team 3 - https://github.com/Joshua-OA/BRIDGING-BARZ - code for their prototype

ARC docs - https://github.com/arcaccra/arc_docs - co-authoring the hub docs (this site)

Prisma - https://github.com/orgs/prisma-collective/ - co-authoring the prisma docs and cloning prisma projects to start customising in their own project spaces. Only the BinBank (aka Bin to Cash) team, lead by Ibn-Salih, did this cloning, the timelining project to use the telegram bot in their prototype. The other collaborators are the prisma team members, and a few from the ARC hub.
