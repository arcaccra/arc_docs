Each of the three teams led their own product development journey, having identified a prototype they would build to test making an intervention into their systems of place. Whilst the second half of the intensive was almost entirely occupied by writing code to try and pull something together before the pitch day on the final day, they also had one week between the end of the intensive and the pitch day for external evaluators. 

Teams were polishing up their demos, as well as their pitches, in preparation. Below are the resources generated by teams, which include product roadmaps for their concepts prototyped.

In addition to these resources, the Bin to Cash team have written a comprehensive roadmap here: [[What's Next]]
