## Morning Reflection Circle

Day 3 began with a post-breakfast reflection circle. Participants stood together in a large circle and took turns sharing insights and reflections from the first two days of the Action Learning Journey. They also expressed gratitude for meaningful moments and learnings, setting an intentional and appreciative tone for the day.

## Session 1: Understanding Value through Evaluation

Following the reflection, Shikhar led a session on **evaluation processes**. The focus was on identifying and articulating value—both personally and collectively. Participants broke into smaller groups to reflect on Day 2's Emergent Learning Table experience and to answer the central question:

- *What values did we uncover during our previous session, and what does 'value' mean for our communities?*

Each group discussed their interpretation of value, both from a personal and community lens. This exercise guided teams to outline what an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) could look like that embodies those values.

### Group Presentations

Once discussions concluded, group leaders presented their insights and early MVP concepts. Highlights included:

- A proposal for **community gaming spaces**—intergenerational hubs designed to spark dialogue, foster connection, and support continued action learning.
- Concepts focused on local empowerment, knowledge sharing, and accessible engagement tools.

## Session 2: Thematic Exploration & Value in Practice

After lunch, the second session opened with a discussion on the **theme of the day**—centered on deepening the understanding of *value* within the Action Learning context.

Participants were assigned to new groups (minimum of four members per group), each in different breakout rooms. Each group addressed one of the following guiding questions:

1. **How is ALJ valuable to individuals and communities?**
2. **How can each participant become a source of value?**
3. **How can the team collectively generate and sustain value?**

This was a highly interactive segment, with facilitators and participants engaging in question-and-answer sessions. Group dialogue was rich, covering practical applications and personal commitments.

## Session 3: Timelining & Schema Development

In the final session of the day, participants were introduced to the **technical process of timelining**—the practice of recording reflections, ideas, and breakthrough moments over time.

Each group:
- Created **schemas** for categorizing content.
- Identified relevant **keywords** to tag specific insights and events.

This process laid the groundwork for deeper storytelling and tracking of impact throughout the journey.

## Closing Circle

The day ended with informal interactions between participants and facilitators, offering space for feedback, clarification, and shared enthusiasm. Energy remained high, and teams began organically forming around shared interests for ongoing collaboration.
