Bernarda is a Counselor who facilitates and co-designs educational and transformational journeys. She is an original member of Iniciativa Murmullo, which is born from the joint need of a community of professionals who considers their practice as the path of development, learning and growth. This community works steadily towards the inner life of social organizations to generate practical, reflective and collaborative practices, thus creating conditions conducive to life.

She works at Vivir Agradecidos facilitating a program based on innovation, neuroscience and mindfulness and as a counselor accompanying individual personal and professional development processes.

Her previous work was to facilitate learning communities in a School Climate and Emotional Education Program led by the provincial government of Buenos Aires for 2000 public schools.

She believes that by deeply connecting with ourselves, with others, with the environment around us, we can find new and better practices that enhance well-being and learning, which can guide us towards a more harmonious and sustainableÂ lifestyle.
