There are our evaluators: 

1. [[Bernada Saine]]
2. [[Clement Matormwasen]]
3. [[Harry Heller]]

**Objective:** To ensure smooth coordination and communication with external evaluators during the Accra action-learning journey. The below plan has been used to engage the external evaluators and schedule the calls for participants to present their work.

### 1. Confirm Availabilities & Dates  
- Reach out to evaluators to confirm availability for the two calls:  
  - Start Call: May 18th, 2025  
  - End Call: June 6th, 2025  
- If necessary, offer alternative dates.
### 2. Confirm Online Conferencing Details  
- Send meeting links and platform details for both calls.  
- Ensure evaluators can join without issues (check time zones).
### 3. Decide on Participation Setup  
- Confirm whether evaluators want to join individually or as one group (camera covering the cohort).  
- Set up accordingly.
### 4. Design Call Structure  
- Start Call: Introductions, journey overview, expectations.  
- End Call: Team presentations, feedback session.
### 5. Communication to Participants for Pitches  
- Send guidelines on how participants should prepare for their final product pitches, focusing on key areas evaluators will assess.
### 6. Confirm Participation with Evaluators  
- Follow up with evaluators to confirm their participation and clarify roles.  
### 7. Onboarding Call for Additional Engagement  
- Offer an optional onboarding call to give evaluators access to additional process spaces (e.g. Telegram, GitHub, Cal.com, Luma etc).
