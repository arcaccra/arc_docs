The purpose of this page is to assist with starting to write to the prisma docs. Care will be given to account for some different starting positions. In short, this is an onboarding/ orientation process.

- What's the role of publishing and the `docs` repo in the context of an [[action-learning journeys|ALJ]] and/ or [[index|prisma]]?
