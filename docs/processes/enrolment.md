Enrolment in the context of Prisma refers to the process of engaging stakeholders and participants in the co-design and preparation phases of [[action-learning journeys]]. This process is crucial for building trust, ensuring alignment with local contexts, and fostering a sense of community ownership.

### **Key Components of Enrolment**
1. **Stakeholder Engagement**  
   - Identifying and engaging key stakeholders from [[communities of place]] and [[communities of practice]].
   - Building relationships based on humility, openness, and a deep understanding of local needs.

2. **Co-Design Process**  
   - Collaborative planning with local stakeholders to ensure that events align with the essence of place.
   - Integrating feedback and insights from diverse perspectives to enrich the design process.

3. **Trust Building**  
   - Recognizing that trust cannot be sped up; it requires consistent engagement and transparent communication.
   - Fostering an environment where stakeholders feel valued and empowered to contribute.

4. **Participant Onboarding**  
   - Developing processes for participant registration, contribution accounting, and participation timelines using tools like the [[DID System]].
   - Ensuring that participants are well-prepared for the intensity and collaborative nature of action-learning journeys.
