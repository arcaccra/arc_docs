**Theory of Change** is a framework that outlines how a set of activities will lead to desired outcomes. It involves mapping causal links between interventions and impacts, ensuring that efforts are strategic and effective.

**Example Use Case:**  
A regenerative project develops a theory of change to guide its efforts in enhancing local biodiversity. This framework helps stakeholders understand how specific actions (e.g., reforestation) will contribute to broader ecological health.
