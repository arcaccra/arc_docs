**Embodied Systemic Constellations** is a method where participants physically represent elements of a system (e.g., stakeholders, resources) and explore their relationships through movement and interaction. It reveals hidden dynamics and patterns.

**Example Use Case**: In a workshop on food systems, participants embody roles like "farmer," "consumer," and "distributor." Through movement and interaction, they experience the interconnectedness and tensions within the system, leading to insights about fair pricing and sustainable practices.
