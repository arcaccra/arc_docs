**Role Play** is a participatory technique where individuals assume different roles to explore diverse perspectives and understand systemic dynamics. It fosters empathy, collaboration, and creative problem-solving.

**Example Use Case:**
In a workshop on food systems, participants role-play as farmers, consumers, and policymakers. This allows them to experience the challenges and trade-offs faced by each stakeholder, leading to the identification of mutually beneficial solutions.
