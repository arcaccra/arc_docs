**Journalling** is a reflective practice used to document insights, emotions, and observations. It helps individuals process experiences and identify patterns, fostering personal growth and systemic understanding.

**Example Use Case:**  
During an action-learning journey, participants maintain journals to reflect on their experiences. This helps them identify emergent patterns and insights, which are then shared in a collective reflection process to inform future actions.
