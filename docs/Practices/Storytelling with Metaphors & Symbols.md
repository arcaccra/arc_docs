**Storytelling with Metaphors & Symbols** is about using stories, metaphors, and symbols to communicate complex ideas in a relatable and engaging way. It helps people connect emotionally and intuitively with systemic concepts.

**Example Use Case**: Imagine a community facing water scarcity. Instead of presenting data, a facilitator tells a story of a river spirit that is suffering due to overuse. The story invokes a sense of connection and responsibility, leading to collaborative solutions for water conservation.
