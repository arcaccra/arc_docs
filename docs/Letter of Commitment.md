# Letter of Commitment
## Context
The following letter of commitment is written by Afia Asamao-Owusu, the Coordinator and Co-founder of the Accra Resource Center (ARC), a community-based learning and organizing space located in Accra, Ghana. This letter is addressed to Prisma, an international team that supports and facilitates the coordination of decentralized events, called action-learning journeys, for which they have a documentation site [here](https://docs.prisma.events/). While this website (arcaccra.com) hosts project updates and materials related to ARC’s participation, Prisma is a separate organizing body. Prisma provides two patterns - [organising](http://docs.prisma.events/processes/) and [publishing](https://docs.prisma.events/patterns/case-study/) - to the hubs on-the-ground as part of the action-learning journey process. This site is a deployment of one version of the docs, which is a component within the publishing pattern, and will be iterated continually throughout the process of the action-learning journey. 

This letter outlines ARC’s commitment to collaborating with Prisma in the context of the upcoming shared initiative.
