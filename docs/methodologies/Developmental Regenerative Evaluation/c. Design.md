## **The Design**  
*Where systemic wisdom meets participatory practice*

### **The Five Spheres: A Tapestry of Vitality**  
Our evaluation framework mirrors life‚Äôs complexity by honoring five interconnected spheres of vitality. These are not silos but living currents that shape‚Äîand are shaped by‚Äîevery regenerative action:  

| Sphere         | What We Measure                                                                 | Example Indicators                                                                 |  
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Ecological** | The dance of soil, water, and biodiversity                                      | Mycelial network density -  Pollinator diversity -  Watershed regeneration rates   |  
| **Social**     | The invisible threads of trust and collaboration                                | Self-reported fairness -  Conflict resolution speed -  Youth leadership engagement  |  
| **Cultural**   | The stories and rituals that bind communities to place                         | Oral histories preserved -  Stewardship role adoption -  Language revitalization   |  
| **Political**  | The flow of power and accountability                                           | Decision-making transparency -  Resource allocation equity -  Civic participation  |  
| **Economic**   | The alchemy of resources into shared abundance                                  | Local currency circulation -  Cooperative revenue growth -  Waste-to-value streams  |  

*These spheres breathe together.* During an [[action-learning journey]] in Accra, youth-led recycling hubs didn‚Äôt just reduce plastic‚Äîthey rewired **economic** flows (creating jobs), **political** trust (co-designing with elders), and **cultural** pride (reviving traditional craft motifs).

### **The Eight Capitals: Nourishing Regenerative Wealth**  
We track eight forms of capital that sustain thriving systems:  
1. **Natural** üå± (forests, soil)  
2. **Social** üë• (trust networks)  
3. **Human** üß† (skills, health)  
4. **Cultural** üé® (stories, rituals)  
5. **Political** üèõÔ∏è (governance capacity)  
6. **Financial** üí∞ (regenerative currencies)  
7. **Built** üèóÔ∏è (resilient infrastructure)  
8. **Digital** üíª (open-source tools)  

*Example:* A Welsh village‚Äôs [[bioregion|bioregional]] learning center measures success not by tourist numbers, but by how these capitals interweave‚Äîelder-led storytelling (**cultural**) training youth in permaculture (**human**), while a [[speech-to-currency]] DAO turns shared wisdom into microgrants (**financial**).

### **Stages of Learning: From Soil to Story**  
1. **Baselining**  
   - *Listening to the land‚Äôs memory*: Co-create health parameters with communities using participatory mapping and [[developmental evaluation|relational audits]].  
   - *Tool*: Sensor networks measure baseline soil pH; elders share oral histories of seasonal cycles.  

2. **Live Signals**  
   - *Feeling the pulse*: Real-time data streams from IoT devices, [[bot arrays]], and community pulse checks.  
   - *Tool*: Telegram bots collect daily reflections during [[docs/Glossary/Enactment]] phases.  

3. **Insights**  
   - *Weaving patterns*: Mixed-method analysis reveals hidden connections (e.g., how compost workshops boosted neighborly trust).  
   - *Tool*: [[Causal Loop Diagrams]] co-drawn in [[Warm Data Labs]].  

4. **Story-Making**  
   - *Breathing data into meaning*: Transform metrics into narratives that sing.  
   - *Tool*: Elders and youth co-create digital ‚Äústory looms‚Äù using [[Holochain|decentralized storytelling platforms]].

### **Data Alchemy: Honoring the Seen and Unseen**  
We gather:  
- **Quantitative**: Sensor metrics -  Tokenized contributions -  Resource flow dashboards  
- **Qualitative**: Voice journals -  [[Embodied Systemic Constellations]] -  Grievance redress logs  
- **Relational**: Trust network maps -  Conflict transformation timelines -  Ceremony participation rates  

*In practice:* During a Guatemalan coffee cooperative‚Äôs evaluation, soil moisture sensors (**quantitative**) merged with women‚Äôs weaving-circle dialogues (**qualitative**) to reveal how shade-grown practices deepened intergenerational bonds (**relational**).

### **The Accra Revelation**  
When youth in Accra‚Äôs [[living lab]] launched a plastic-upcycling DAO, our framework captured:  
- **Ecological**: 12 tons diverted from landfills (but *also* restored mangrove microhabitats)  
- **Cultural**: Revival of Adinkra symbol-carving in recycled art  
- **Political**: Co-governance pact between elders and tech-savvy youth  
- **Economic**: [[Capital Distribution|community token]] circulating across 14 microbusinesses  

The data didn‚Äôt just measure‚Äîit *invited*. Neighboring villages now adapt the model through [[process infrastructuring]], seeding a bioregional movement.
