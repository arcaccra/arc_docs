## **Technology**

Our e-valuation methodology leverages cutting-edge Web3 technologies and decentralized tools to create a robust, transparent, and participatory evaluation ecosystem. Here's an overview of the key technological components:

### **Core Infrastructure**

1. **Lu.ma**: 
   - Used for event registration and participant onboarding.
   - Integrates with our [[DID System]] for secure identity management.

2. **Telegram**:
   - **Chats**: Facilitate real-time communication and community engagement.
   - **Bots**: Automate data collection, contribution tracking, and peer recognition.

3. **Wiki Publishing Engine**:
   - A [[Holochain]]-based platform for collaborative documentation of case studies and insights.
   - Enables decentralized knowledge commoning across [[bioregion|bioregions]].

4. **Smart Contracts & DAOs**:
   - Automate resource distribution and governance decisions.
   - Implement [[capital distribution]] protocols for transparent fund allocation.

### **Data Collection & Analysis**

1. **Voice and Written Journalling Analysis**:
   - AI-powered tools for sentiment analysis and pattern recognition in participant reflections.
   - Integrates with our [[developmental evaluation]] framework to capture qualitative insights.

2. **Product Development Submissions**:
   - Holochain-based [[DID System]] for tracking contributions and innovations.
   - Enables [[speech-to-currency]] conversion for recognizing value creation.

3. **Facilitator Reports**:
   - Structured data collection interfaces for [[Core Facilitator Capacity|facilitator teams]].
   - Real-time synthesis of insights to inform adaptive management.

4. **Peer Reviews**:
   - Decentralized reputation systems for community-driven quality assurance.
   - Integrates with DAOs for participatory governance of evaluation criteria.

### **Proof Systems**

1. **Proof of Work**:
   - Tokenize participant contributions using [[speech-to-currency]] protocols.
   - Capture diverse forms of value creation beyond traditional metrics.

2. **Proof of Impact**:
   - Link outcomes to funding via [[capital distribution]] DAOs.
   - Enable real-time, transparent allocation of resources based on measurable impact.

### **Integration & Interoperability**

Our technology stack is designed for seamless integration with existing tools and emerging innovations:

- **API-First Architecture**: Enables easy connection with sensor networks, IoT devices, and external data sources.
- **Modular Design**: Allows for rapid iteration and incorporation of new tools as they emerge.
- **Open Standards**: Commitment to interoperability ensures our system can evolve with the broader Web3 ecosystem.

### **Case Study: Accra Action-Learning Journey**

During the Accra ALJ, our technology enabled:
- Real-time tracking of plastic waste diversion using IoT sensors.
- Tokenization of youth contributions to recycling initiatives.
- DAO-governed microgrants for community-led innovations.
- Decentralized storytelling platform capturing elder wisdom on traditional craft motifs.

This technological infrastructure not only facilitated data collection but also embodied the principles of decentralization and community ownership central to our [[Regenerative Development & Design]] approach.
